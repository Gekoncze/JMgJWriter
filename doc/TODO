    token writers
        think more on how new lines should be handled in token writers
            possibly we could have both single line writers and multi-line writers
        consider supporting both single line and multi line comments
            need to make sure that single line comment will end with new line
            while still not breaking other tokens
            think of how to handle new lines and escape sequences
